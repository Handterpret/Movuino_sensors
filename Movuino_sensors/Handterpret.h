//!  Handterpret class.
/*!
  This class stores MPU sensor values.
  It aims to process these metrics to detect forearm movements.\n\n

  As we had hardware problems with gyroscope module of the MPU6050, We decided to cut off the rotation detection part of this project.
  All sections of the code refering to this part are commented in the check_movement` function.
